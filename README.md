## KAPE8bit Emulator

KAPE8bit is a homebrew 6502 computer I've been making on and off since summer 2020. This is the emulator for it. It's a simple interpreter, so it's not the fastest it can be, though getting 4MHz speeds at 60 FPS should be reachable with even older hardware.

Currently, everything is a mess so don't expect anything.
